# Introductie

I will create a Data dashboard from data that discripes the effect of betuline acid on the methilation of promotor regions of some gene, primarialy the genes from the P53 pathway. This data was generated by students from Hanzehogeschool groningen.


*Nov 20 2024*

I recieved the data from the project manager, the data consist of two types of csv files: All reads or only regions of interest.

The All read files consist of 5 columns: chromosome, start and end position (which always seem to only include only 1 position.), a frac column and a valid column.

The regions of interest files have 3 columns: chromosome, position and gene.

In barcodes.csv are the types of patients given for each barcode (heathy, control, etc.).
